## The Repository
This is the repository of the mobile app for driving and managing car models from the [`S(car)lett`](https://github.com/sesame0707/S-car-lett) project.

## High-Level Goals
Those are the initial goals of this module:
- Compliance with new standards
- High software modularity
- Dark theme

All of the above goals have been achieved throughout this module's implementation.

## Results
The resulting software is a native Android app written in `Kotlin` (backend) and `XML` (frontend). The app requires a device with Android version `9` or higher. Every UI component is compliant with `Material Design`, and the app encompasses three fragments:
- Dashboard
- Settings
- About

They look as following (light theme, vertical orientation):
